This is a short description of the relevant features I worked on for the group project.

Project: ChatBot for Fontys ICT

1. Implemented a search engine feature inside the chatbot, which is toggleable
from the chat popup, which returns relevant results from Bing after the user inputs
a search query.

2. As per the PO's requirements, I integrated the Microsoft Graph Service into our project,
by utilizing the MSGraph API. This also includes authenticating the Graph Client
with an authentication token from Microsoft, via the OAuth2.0 flow.

3. Took part in implementing the initial version of a keyword-matching algorithm
to find solutions for user-typed questions, along with Jesper Boersma.
