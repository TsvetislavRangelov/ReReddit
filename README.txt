# ReReddit

This project is a clone of Reddit. It is built from scratch utilizing TypeScript React for client-side and Spring Boot Java for server-side. The repo is transferred from my institutional GitLab account, which means that the CI/CD pipeline is missing here on GitHub. A lot of documentation can be found in the root folder of the project which can give some insight into the development process. 

## Note
This repo is only the server code. A separate repository of the same name has the client code.
